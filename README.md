# 🚀 Dont Email Passwords!

Spin up this Node.js app in Docker or as a standalone app to to have your own secure password sharing service. 🧪

This is a direct spinoff from https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher but written in NodeJs, it provides APIs, and uses less memory (all of these requirements that I had)
